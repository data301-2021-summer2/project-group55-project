## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Since air pollution in nowadays is not only a local problem, but also a global problem. It is important for people to explore a way to decrease air pollution. However, before finding the way to achieve this goal, it is crucial to know which factors is controllong the concentration of a specific pollutant and responsible for the decline in air quality and this dataset might give us some answer for that. In this project, what I hope to do is try finding the some factors that has an influences on the concentration of a specific chemical compound.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This was a dataset with data of the concentration of five various types of chemical compounds along with other useful information in an area with serious air pollution in a city of Italy. The dataset was provided by Saverio De Vito, who worked for National Agency for New Technologies. The data was collected by using a Air Quality Chemical Multisensor Device. To ensure the accuracy of data, the data were recored hourly, from March 2004 to Feburary 2005. The purpose of collecting these data was intent for academic research.
